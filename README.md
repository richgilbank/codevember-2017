# Codevember 2017

This is the source from each experiment I made for Codevember 2017. I'm not sticking to the [themes](http://codevember.xyz/), just using it as an opportunity to try some new things. 

The code is ðŸš® but maybe it will be helpful to someone wondering how to get started. Happy to hear feedback/thoughts/ideas/questions!
